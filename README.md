## JBrowse2 Integration

The whole code in this repository is integrated as a submodule in [GMOD](http://gmod.org/wiki/Main_Page)'s
 [JBrowse-Components](https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse-components). 
 We are currently stashing our code @https://github.com/graph-genome/jbrowse-components/tree/pangenome_group_testing.
 
 In order to get the plugin in JBrowse-Web to run, execute the following
 steps:
 
 Clone the JBrowse-Components repository:
 
 `git clone --recurse-submodules -b pangenome_group_testing git@github.com:graph-genome/jbrowse-components.git`

Install dependencies:
 
 `cd jbrowse-components/`
 
 `yarn`
 
 Start the development server (it takes some time until it is up...):
 
 `(cd packages/jbrowse-web/ && yarn start)`
 
 Navigate to `File` -> `New pangenome view`. Now you have a PangenomeView track running in JBrowse2!
 
 ### Developer Notes

 All test files must be copied to `jbrowse-components/packages/jbrowse-web/test_data`. 
 In `jbrowse-components/packages/pangenome-view/src/PangenomeView/components/prototype/src/PangenomeSchematic.js` change path `data` to path `test_data` so that we point to the currect folder for our data to load.
